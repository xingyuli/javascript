		One of the important goals of CSS is to separate document content and structure from document presentation. Specifying styles with the style attribute of individual HTML tags does not accomplish this (although it can be a useful technique for DHTML). To achieve the separation of structure from presentation, we use style sheets, which group all the style information into a single place. A CSS style sheet consists of a set of style rules. Each rule begins with a selector that specifies the document element or elements to which it applies, followed by a set of style attributes and their values within curly braces. The simplest kind of rule defines styles for one or more specific tag names.
